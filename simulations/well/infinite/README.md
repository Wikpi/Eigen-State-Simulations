# Infinite Square Well Simulation

Compute bound-state energies and wavefunctions for a one-dimensional infinite square well by numerically integrating the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation and locating eigenvalues via a bracketing method.

## Description

**Potential**  
V(x) =
    0, for 0 < x < L  
    infinite, otherwise

**Objective**  
Finding numerical solutions that satisfy the condition of making the wavelength vanish at the well wall.

## Requirements

Python 3.8+ or later
NumPy  
SciPy  
Matplotlib
